## Key Concepts to Review

### Weekly Review (Essential)

#### STAR Framework
- [ ] Situation: 15% (context, stakes)
- [ ] Task: 15% (your role, challenge)
- [ ] Action: 50% (specific "I" actions)
- [ ] Result: 20% (quantified + learning)

#### Time Management
- [ ] Target: 2-3 minutes per response
- [ ] Pause before answering (1-2 seconds)
- [ ] Watch interviewer engagement

#### Story Requirements
- [ ] Recent (3-5 years)
- [ ] Resolved (not ongoing)
- [ ] Specific (not hypothetical)
- [ ] Impactful (staff-level)

### Monthly Review (Frameworks)

#### Influence Tactics (in order of effectiveness)
1. Shared goals
2. Data & evidence
3. Expert credibility
4. Relationships
5. Coalition building
6. Escalation (last resort)

#### Conflict Resolution Steps
