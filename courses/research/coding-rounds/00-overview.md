# Coding Rounds - Overview

## Topic Definition and Importance

Coding rounds are a critical evaluation component for senior, staff, and staff+ level engineering positions. Unlike junior-level interviews that may focus on basic algorithmic knowledge, staff-level coding interviews assess:

1. **Production-quality code writing ability** - Clean, maintainable, well-structured code
2. **Problem decomposition skills** - Breaking complex problems into manageable components
3. **Real-world engineering judgment** - Making appropriate trade-offs and architectural decisions
4. **Technical communication** - Explaining thought processes clearly while coding

At staff level, interviewers expect candidates to demonstrate not just the ability to solve problems, but to solve them in a way that reflects years of professional experience.

## Scope and Boundaries

### In Scope
- Algorithm design and analysis
- Data structure selection and implementation
- Code quality and software engineering best practices
- Non-LeetCode style practical problems
- System component implementation (caches, parsers, schedulers)
- Concurrency and thread-safety considerations
- Testing strategies and edge case handling

### Out of Scope
- Pure theoretical computer science questions
- System design (covered separately)
- Behavioral questions (covered separately)
- Language-specific trivia

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

1. **Solve algorithmic problems efficiently** under time pressure
2. **Write production-quality code** with proper abstractions, error handling, and testing
3. **Communicate your approach** clearly while coding
4. **Handle non-LeetCode style questions** that focus on real-world scenarios
5. **Identify and apply common patterns** across different problem types
6. **Manage time effectively** during coding interviews

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Time Management
**Problem**: Running out of time before completing the solution
**Solution**:
- Practice with strict time limits (30-40 minutes for medium problems)
- Start with a working solution, then optimize
- Verbalize your approach before coding to catch issues early

### Challenge 2: Handling Ambiguity
**Problem**: Questions are intentionally vague or underspecified
**Solution**:
- Ask clarifying questions upfront
- State your assumptions explicitly
- Start with a simple case and expand

### Challenge 3: Code Quality Under Pressure
**Problem**: Writing messy code when stressed
**Solution**:
- Practice writing clean code until it becomes automatic
- Use meaningful variable names even in interviews
- Refactor as you go rather than at the end

### Challenge 4: Non-LeetCode Questions
**Problem**: Unfamiliar with practical coding challenges
**Solution**:
- Practice implementing real systems (LRU cache, log parser)
- Focus on API design and modularity
- Write comprehensive tests as part of your solution

### Challenge 5: Articulating Thought Process
**Problem**: Going silent while coding
**Solution**:
- Practice thinking aloud during practice sessions
- Explain trade-offs as you make decisions
- Narrate what you're testing and why

## Interview Format Variations

### Traditional LeetCode-Style
- 45-60 minutes per question
- Focus: Algorithm efficiency and correctness
- Companies: Meta, Google, Amazon

### Non-LeetCode Practical Style
- 60-90 minutes for multi-part questions
- Focus: Code quality, testing, real-world applicability
- Companies: Netflix, Stripe, OpenAI, Anthropic

### Pair Programming Style
- Collaborative problem solving
- Focus: Communication and teamwork
- Companies: Pivotal (now VMware Tanzu)

### Take-Home Assessments
- 2-4 hours at home
- Focus: Complete, polished solutions
- Companies: Various startups

## Success Metrics at Staff Level

At staff level, interviewers evaluate:

| Criteria | Junior Expectation | Staff Expectation |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Correctness | Works for basic cases | Handles all edge cases |
| Efficiency | Reasonable complexity | Optimal or near-optimal |
| Code Quality | Readable | Production-ready |
| Communication | Explains solution | Drives discussion, considers alternatives |
| Testing | Basic test cases | Comprehensive test strategy |
